## CoN&Co Lab's Open Toolkit ##

This repository contains CoN&Co Lab's software toolkit. The toolkit includes (or will include) code files, full pipelines and tutorials for the experimental and computational routines of the Lab. It is a work in progress and will be updated continuously.

The toolkit was conceived in the spirit of open and reproducible science, and is made available with scientific and educational purposes in mind.
