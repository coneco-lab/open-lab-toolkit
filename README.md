## CoN&Co's Open Lab Toolkit ##

This repository contains CoN&Co Lab's software toolkit. The toolkit includes (or will include) code files, full pipelines and tutorials that describe the experimental and computational routines of the Lab. 

The toolkit was conceived in the spirit of open and reproducible science, and is made available with scientific and educational purposes in mind. It will grow with the Lab's activity as software and knowledge become mature enough for sharing.
